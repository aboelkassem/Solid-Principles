# Solid-Principles
**SOLID** principles are the design principles that enable us manage most of the software design problems promoted by Robert C. Martin and introduced by Michael Feathers.

it is a mnemonic acronym. It helps to define the five basic object-oriented design principles to make software designs more understandable, flexible and maintainable:

1. **S**ingle Responsibility Principle
2. **O**pen-Closed Principle
3. **L**iskov Substitution Principle
4. **I**nterface Segregation Principle
5. **D**ependency Inversion Principle

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

- The Code/Class/Method "do one thing and do it well"
- Uncle Bob, "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change"
- A Class or method Should have one and only one reason to change, Meaning that a class should have only one job or responsible for one part of the functionality

### Example:
